# Taxi_trips_analysis_with_python 

The dataset used in this project is available publicly:
https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page

# The dataset description:

The trip records for yellow and green taxis as well as for-hire vehicles (FHVs) include essential fields such as pick-up and drop-off dates/times, locations, trip distances, fares, rate types, payment methods, and passenger counts. These datasets were collected and provided to the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) by authorized technology providers under the Taxicab & Livery Passenger Enhancement Programs (TPEP/LPEP) and FHV Trip Record submissions made by bases. However, the TLC does not create this trip data and does not guarantee its accuracy. 

# The dataset includes:

pickup - trip start time
dropoff - trip end time
passengers - the number of passengers on the trip
distance - the distance of the trip
fare - the basic fare for the trip
tip - tip size
tolls - payment for toll roads (the passenger also pays for this)
total - total fare for the trip
color - the color of the car that made the trip
payment - payment method
pickup_zone - the zone in which the trip began
dropoff_zone - the zone in which the trip ended
pickup_borough - the district where the trip started
dropoff_borough - the district where the trip ended

# The tasks set

1)Payment Analysis by Location:

Examine dynamics of total payments by borough.
Identify borough with highest daily payments for taxi trips.
Analyze sums of daily payments for trips in each district.
Compare distribution of daily payment sums by boroughs.

2)Payment Analysis by Time and Type:

Display histograms of monthly payments by car color.
Identify days and hours with largest payments for trips.

3)Tip Analysis:

Investigate relationship between trip distance and tip size.
Analyze dynamics of tips in boroughs where passengers were picked up.
Build box plot of tip size by district of trip start.
Determine if number of passengers affects average tip.
These groupings help to organize the analysis tasks based on the aspect of the data they focus on, enabling a more structured approach to deriving insights and making informed decisions.
